                    1. Self-driving cars become mainstream and the majority of vehicles sold are fully autonomous.
                </div>
                <br>Self-driving cars have been a topic of conversation for years, but in 2023, we may finally see them 
                become mainstream. With advancements in technology and increased testing, the majority of vehicles 
                sold could be fully autonomous. This has the potential to revolutionize transportation and reduce 
                accidents caused by human error. Additionally, self-driving cars could have a significant impact on the 
                economy, with the potential to create new industries and job opportunities.

                    2. Augmented Reality (AR) technology advances to the point where we see the widespread adoption of AR headsets, 
                    making virtual reality obsolete. 
                </div>
                <br>As AR technology advances, we may see a shift away from virtual reality (VR) towards augmented reality (AR). 
                AR headsets could become more widespread, enabling us to overlay digital information onto the real world. This 
                has the potential to revolutionize everything from gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare. With AR,
                we could create immersive experiences that blend the digital and physical worlds in new and exciting ways.
